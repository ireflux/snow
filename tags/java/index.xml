&lt;p>Recently,I was learning the Spring Framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, I learn it from Spring official website of the guide. When I completed the first few guides, I find that I didn’t even understand why. So I had to give up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, I looked for other guides to learn and saw many examples of IOC(Inversion of Control), DI(Dependency Injection), and AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming). I probably understand, but I still can&amp;rsquo;t use the Spirng framework. on the forum, Someone told me that I only need more practice. But I don&amp;rsquo;t even know it how to work, e.g. annotation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
